# Library Management System

This project is made using React js and deployed at https://devrev-task-eta.vercel.app/. The frontend files are inside src folder. Only the frontend is implemented. Backend yet to be done! ^^

# To run this project locally, follow these steps:-

1. Run the frontend server with 'npm start' command from the project folder.
2. The project runs on http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

# Problem Statement:-

Build a simple library management page where:

1. Users should be able to see the list of books -> Instead of loading all the results on the page, perform paging on the list of books – either implement 10 results per page or load on scroll will be a bonus.
2. Users should be able to filter the list of books based on Title, Author, Subject and Publish date -> User should be able to see the count of books in based on each criteria (Title, Author, Subject and publish-date)

# Features of the Library Management System:- 

1. Search bar -> Connects the input given to Google Books Api and displays the results. [Extra Feature]
2. Home Page -> Displays the collection of books in a card format with horizontal scrolling feature. [Extra Feature]
3. View Books -> All books in the library are listed here. [Given Feature] -> 
 ● Pagination implemented: 10 results per page is listed. Page indexes are given below to change pages.     
 ● Filter search implemented: Filter the list of books based on Title, Author, Subject and Release date. Users can also see the total count of books based on each filter criteria.
4. Login, Signup Page -> A simple frontend of login and signup page is displayed.
5. Borrow Books -> The books user borrows (from home page - books collection) are displayed here. [Yet to be implemented]
6. Navbar and Footer -> Simple and easy to navigate navigataion bar and a footer is designed.

# Implementation of the project:
